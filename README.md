# What is co-code?

Co-Code is a platform for computer students to collaborate in different projects to learn new - or improve their existing coding skills 🧑🏻‍💻, make connections with brilliant minds 💡, make a profile where they can share their progress and the projects and roles they worked on so far 📊, and join interesting projects based on their current level and what they want to learn 🧗🏻‍♂️. For each project, there is an expert supervisor who guides students and encourage them to take out the best in them 🪂 .
